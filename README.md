- I HATE legacy software. I hate bad software design. That I really do. 

- I LOVE that In my current job, I currently have a huge change to go from full legacy to state of the art, and write down my experiences and stories I encounter on that road.
  - Will I succeed?
  - Or will I be crucified by the guys who converted to the dark side?
  - Time will tell.

- I think someday I'll write a book about that. To safe others from fighting through that on their own.
