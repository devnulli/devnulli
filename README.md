 ### What I do. ###
Sometimes, I like to code some stuff, apart from work. Don't know why. I like coding live, to groovy music. It relaxes me. 

### About my job ###
I HATE legacy software. I hate bad software design. That I really do. 
And that is, right now, why I live deep, deep in that legacy world. 

When I entered my current job, I was SHOCKED! When I saw the first code lines, my first instinct was (literally) to stand up, and quit right away. I would never accept working in that environment. With that multi million â‚¬ piece of worthless crap, sold as a success to the stakeholders...

Next thing I remember, I had a talk with my boss, and what can I say. He said something in the effect of. "Well? How do you like it here?". And I think I said something like "I have never seen anything that bad before, in 13 years of my software-engineering career"...  and he kept on: "Yeh well, I heard it's not that good..." he said, pretty pragmatic about it. "Yes, we need to tackle that. We need people who see the problem." --- *Ok, I said. I want to help.* 

## Inner Monologue ##
(Mind: "Wait.. You wanted to quit, and now.. are you crazy? They have been working that way for years, decades.. and you go there and tell them it sucks, and you can do better... don't you think your're out of your league. You should have just gone to a NORMAL software-company, with state-of-the-art standards..")

(Heart: "Yea. Sorry but I cant resist watching that story to the end.."")

### So, why didn't I just leave that nonsense? ###

It took me a while to realize what just happened. My opinion about that source code is somewhere between "time to put it to sleep" and "sue the creators"... Why should I stay and and fight to save that? Tell you why.

Of course, I could just shake my head and move on to something else? I could do that. But I would miss a huge story. 
**Everyone can produce good and clean code in a good and clean environment.** We learn that fast.
**But..** somewhere in my belly I felt, that I would miss hell of a story, if I take the easy way out now. And a lot of learnings. 
  - What excactly does that mean: **good and clean enviroment**
  - Best way to learn that is to try and create one myself
  - Not from scratch, but from hell.

So I chose the first option.. And I learned to love my job.  Not for the coding (not yet). It's god damn legacy hell.. BUT:

I LOVE that In my current job, I currently have a huge chance to try and move something big from full legacy to state of the art, and write down my experiences and stories I encounter on that road. A chance, I will never get again in my life. So. I stayed. 

## NOW LET'S SEE ##

Lets see what I will learn from this journey.

  - Will I succeed? Or will it break me?
  
  - Will I be strong enough to battle that legacy pain creeping in my mind? Or will it zombify me, make me a legacy programmer as well.
    - Will I become slave to those processes and empty and inefficient word hulls??
    - Will I become a messiaas? Not only Promising but only delivering an Island of happiness? A way out?
    - Will they even listen?
  
  - Will _that legacy system_ change me? Break me? Or will I change _that damn legacy software_? Turn around the wheel?
  
  - Will I be crucified by those developes and consultants who fear or fail to understand these concepts? Who now live pretty good of the cost, surreality, and inefficience, and damage they caused? Or worse? Make ME become a "dark side" programmer? One of them?
  
- Time will tell.

- I think someday I'll write a book about that. Yeeees!
