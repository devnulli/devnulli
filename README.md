I HATE legacy software. I hate bad software design. That I really do. 
Right now, I live deep in that legacy world. 
When I entered my current job, I was SHOCKED! Shall I stay and fight? Shall I shake head and move on to something else? 
I chose the first option.

I LOVE that In my current job, I currently have a huge chance to try and move something big from full legacy to state of the art, and write down my experiences and stories I encounter on that road. A chance, I will never get again in my life. So. I stayed in that hell.
BUT:
  - Will I succeed? Or will it break me?
  
  - Will I be strong enough to battle that legacy pain creeping in my mind? Or will it zombify me, make me a legacy programmer as well.
    - Will I become slave to those processes and empty and inefficient word hulls??
    - Will I become a messiaas? Not only Promising but only delivering an Island of happiness? A way out?
    - Will they even listen?
  
  - Will _that legacy system_ change me? Break me? Or will I change _that damn legacy software_? Turn around the wheel?
  
  - Or will I be crucified by those developes and consultants who fear or fail to understand these concepts? Who now live pretty good of the cost, surreality, and inefficience, and damage they caused?
    - Or worse? Make ME become a "dark side" programmer? One of them?
  
  - Time will tell.

- I think someday I'll write a book about that. Yeeees!
